/**
 * Given a value N, if we want to make change for N cents, and we have infinite
 * supply of each of S = { S1, S2, .. , Sm} valued coins, how many ways can we
 * make the change? The order of coins doesnâ€™t matter.
 * 
 * For example, for N = 4 and S = {1,2,3}, there are four solutions:
 * 
 * {1,1,1,1}, {1,1,2}, {2,2}, {1,3}.
 * 
 * So output should be 4.
 * 
 * For N = 10 and S = {2, 5, 3, 6}, there are five solutions:
 * 
 * {2,2,2,2,2}, {2,2,3,3}, {2,2,6}, {2,3,5} and {5,5}.
 * 
 * So the output should be 5.

     * If current target value is smaller than 0, we back track to upper
